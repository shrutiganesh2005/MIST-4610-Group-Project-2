**Dataset Description:**
The Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset for New York City, accessible through this link, https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/motor-vehicle-collisions-crashes, records each vehicular crash reported to the NYPD. Information is collected via MV-104AN forms which are filled out for crashes involving significant injury, death, or damages exceeding $1,000. This dataset includes a variety of data dimensions such as the crash date and time, borough location, zip code, and specific street coordinates. It also details the type and number of injuries or deaths involved, contributing factors to the crash, collision ID, and vehicle types involved. It uses several data formats to provide a detailed view of traffic accidents throughout New York City.

**Question One:** From the years 2020-2024, which boroughs in New York had the most and least number of people killed in car crashes?
   
**Importance & Relevance:**

**Health and Safety:** The map shows where more accidents happen, helping us find the dangerous spots so we can try to stop people from getting hurt or dying in car accidents.

**Roads and Planning:** This info helps figure out where we might need speed bumps or better streetlights to make roads safer.

**Money Matters:** Car crashes cost a lot — in emergency help, medical bills, and when people can’t work. Understanding where crashes happen can help manage these costs.

**People Power:** If people know where the most accidents are, they can work together to make their neighborhoods safer.

**Laws and Rules:** The government can make new traffic laws, like lower speed limits or better traffic lights, to make roads safer if they know where the most crashes are happening.


**Tie to the Dataset:**
The dataset from the link, https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/motor-vehicle-collisions-crashes,  is really useful for seeing car crash patterns in New York. It's got a full list of crashes, complete with exact spots where they occurred. When we put this info on a map, we can spot the areas with the most problems at a glance. This kind of map helps us see trends, like if one borough has more accidents than another. With this knowledge, city planners and safety officials can work on making those high-crash areas safer for everyone


**Question Two:** Out of the two boroughs found with the most and least number of people killed in car crashes, which specific car model had the most people killed during the same time period?

The time period displayed is contrained to the years 2020 through 2024. The borough of Brooklyn is visually the darkest portion on the map due to having the highest rates of people killed in car crashes. Brooklyn is known for its popular attractions including Coney Island and the Brooklyn Bridge, leading to a high number of people consistently within this area. The number of cars on the road is drastically higher than other regions in New York, and the data reveals that the highest number of accidents occuring here aligns with the apparent popularity of the area. Statistics show that 130 people were killed and 29,058 people were injured in car crashes within the Brooklyn borough between 2020 and 2024. 

On the other hand, the borough with the lowest rate of people killed in crashes was Staten Island. Out of all the boroughs in New York, Staten Island has the lowest population altogether. Statistics show that 18 people were killed and 2,839 people were injured in car crashes within the Staten Island borough between 2020 and 2024. This data also aligns with the fact that the borough is sparsely populated in comparison to the rest of New York.

Relative to each other, Brooklyn is known for its large city presence while Staten Island is known for its prominent green spaces and historical buildings. The living areas of these two boroughs match up with the car crash statistics, allowing researchers to make sense of the meaning behind certain data and which parts of New York are more populated compared to others.

After finding which boroughs had the most deaths from car crashes, we found which specific vehicles in each region were responsible for the most crashes. After determining the number deaths for each type of vehicle, we condensed the data to the top five vehicles with the most crashes: bus, e-bike, motorcycle, sedan, and station wagon/sport utility vehicle. 

Relative to each other, Brooklyn having the highest number of deaths and Staten Island having the lowest number of deaths, both shared the similarity of the type of vehicle causing the most deaths. The Sedan caused 13,663 people to be injured and 42 people to be killed between the years 2020-2024 in Brooklyn, NY. In Staten Island, Sedan vehicles caused 1,728 people to be injured and 9 people to be killed. 

On the other hand, the vehicle with the lowest number of deaths was also similar to both boroughs. 437 people were injured by e-bike and 3 were killed in Brooklyn between 2020 and 2024. 2 people were injured and 1 person was killed by e-bike in Staten Island between 2020 and 2024. While each borough has vastly different populations, they both show similarities in aiding researchers to figure out which vehicles seem to be more dangerous on the road.
