**Dataset Description:**
The Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset for New York City, accessible via this link which is https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/motor-vehicle-collisions-crashes, records each vehicular crash reported to the NYPD. Information is collected via MV-104AN forms which are filled out for crashes involving significant injury, death, or damages exceeding $1,000. This dataset includes a variety of data dimensions such as the crash date and time, borough location, zip code, and specific street coordinates. It also details the type and number of injuries or deaths involved, contributing factors to the crash, collision ID, and vehicle types involved. It uses several data formats to provide a detailed view of traffic accidents throughout New York City
